# Project Description


# How to launch project
- Cd into server directory `cd server`
- Seed the database `python3 seed.py`   (Optional)
- Run the application `flask run` or `python3 app.py`
- Open the provided link in postman or on browser

**Note** 
-  The restful API is based on JSON format so all `POST` requests should be in JSON and the responses will also be in JSON.
-  If you post data into the database then run `seed.py` the data will be deleted. Its better to post after running seed.py so that you can view your data.
- The seed data is mainly for helping to visualize the `GET` responses.
- There are more HTTP requests which can be sent in the API . Explore them within the resources in the app.py file
